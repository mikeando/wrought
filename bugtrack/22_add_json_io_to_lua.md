# Add `read_file_json` and `write_file_json` to lua scripting

## Status: P2

## Problem 

It is tricky to maintain state without having some way to read/write structured data to files.
We already have `read_file` and `write_file` but they work with raw text. It would be nice
to be able to read/write structured data.
