# Support accessing a knowledgebase

## Status: P2 - Large - Needs shaping

## Problem 

We want some kind of queryable knowwldegebase that scripts can access.

Presumably this will be some kind of graph database, and some kind of vector-db.

## Design

### API???

Do we provide graph-db and vector-db apis. And/or do we provide something higher-level?
