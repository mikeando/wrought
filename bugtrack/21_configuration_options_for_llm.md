# Expose various configuration options for the LLMs

## Status: P2

## Problem 

At the moment we have the type of LLM hard-coded, and we dont have ways to set various
configutation options (like maximum return length, temperature, etc).

It would be nice to make some of these configurable from scripts / config files.
